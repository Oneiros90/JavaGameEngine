# JavaGameEngine
A basic 2D Game Engine written in Java

This is a little personal project made for fun. I wanted to try building from scratch the most minimal 2D Game Engine possible using only Java standard APIs.

The engine has these features:
- A very accurate rendering loop in a dedicated thread with frames per second calculation
- A GUI manager using AWT+Swing features 
- A resources manager that easly controls loading of images, sounds and other kind of files from the disk
- A basic physic engine with position, speed and collisions calculations
- A test example in the main() function, benchmarking the number of sprites simultaneously rendered within the same window keeping an high framerate

This engine is far from being a complete framework but it can be used as a starting point for VERY basic projects, not for real games (check LibGDX if you are looking for a real java game engine)
